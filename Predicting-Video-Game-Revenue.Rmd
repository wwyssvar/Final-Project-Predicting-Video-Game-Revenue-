# 1. Problem Definition

The main question of this project is: Which factors help predict the revenue of a video game? Using the Gaming Industry Trends dataset, we investigate how platform, genre, release year, and other features relate to a game’s financial performance.

This question is interesting because the gaming industry continues to grow, and understanding the features associated with higher revenue can help studios, marketers, and developers make informed decisions. Predictive insights can also help identify which types of games tend to perform well in the market.

The objective of this analysis is to build linear models that use game characteristics to estimate revenue and to identify which variables are most strongly associated with higher or lower revenue. Our goal is not to perfectly predict sales but to understand which factors contribute meaningfully to revenue patterns in the dataset.

Key assumptions include:

* The dataset is accurate and represents industry trends fairly.

* Revenue is influenced by the variables included (platform, genre, release year, etc.).

* Linear modeling is appropriate for exploring these relationships.


# 2. Data Acquisition & Description

The dataset is called Gaming Industry Trends and the source for the dataset is Kaggle. We obtained the dataset through the download link on the Kaggle website. The main features would include game title, genre, platform, release year, and revenue, along with possible additional fields describing popularity or rating. The approximate number of rows and columns would be 1000 rows and 11 columns. Some biases to take into consideration would be sampling bias. The dataset would subject to sampling bias due to the limited amount of data given (only 1000 rows). This constraint can exclude large portions of the gaming industry, particularly small studios, niche genres, and emerging platforms. 

As a result, the observed trends may reflect more mainstream titles.

# 3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

```{r}

# Read in the raw CSV
gaming_raw <- read.csv("gaming_industry_trends.csv")

# Rename messy column names with periods to cleaner names with dashes
gaming_raw <- gaming_raw %>%
  rename(
    Game_Title              = Game.Title,
    Release_Year            = Release.Year,
    Revenue_Millions        = Revenue..Millions...,
    Players_Millions        = Players..Millions.,
    Peak_Concurrent_Players = Peak.Concurrent.Players,
    Metacritic_Score        = Metacritic.Score,
    Esports_Popularity      = Esports.Popularity,
    Trending_Status         = Trending.Status
  )

# Drop any possible rows with missing key values
gaming_clean <- gaming_raw |>
  filter(
    !is.na(Revenue_Millions),
    !is.na(Genre),
    !is.na(Platform),
    !is.na(Release_Year)
  ) |>
# Remove any possible invalid numeric values
  filter(
    Revenue_Millions > 0,
    Players_Millions >= 0,
    Metacritic_Score >= 0,
    Metacritic_Score <= 100
  ) |>
# Convert variables to appropriate types
  mutate(
    Genre              = as.factor(Genre),
    Platform           = as.factor(Platform),
    Esports_Popularity = as.factor(Esports_Popularity),
    Trending_Status    = as.factor(Trending_Status),
    Release_Year       = as.integer(Release_Year)
  )
