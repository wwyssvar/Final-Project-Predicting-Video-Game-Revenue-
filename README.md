The final project should be submitted by Monday December 8 (PDF uploaded to Canvas, all code committed and pushed to GitHub).

To make sure that you stay on track, you are expected to complete certain portions of the Final Project by these milestones (1pt of your grade for this project will be awarded for meeting each milestone):

Milestone 1: Brainstorm ideas for questions in small groups.

* By Thursday November 20 you need to meet the instructor to discuss your project idea. You can book a meeting with the instructor here ( https://gmuedu-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/vmalhot2_gmu_edu/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9498494A-4860-4F00-BDA7-2DD32B64D334%7D&file=DL4%20Time%20Slot.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true ) You should have the following:
  * Your question.
  * Your dataset.
* Then by Friday November 21, you need to submit the proposal that contains the following:

  * Your question, stated in one of the two formats given in the instructions on GitHub.
  * Your dataset and the column names of the two variables you need for that question, and which is your response variable and which is your explanatory variable.
  * Whether you will be using a linear model or a hypothesis test to answer your question.
  * 1-2 sentences explaining why this is an interesting question to ask.
  The template for the proposal is in the starter kit given below.

Milestone 2: Complete a first draft of the Question of Interest, Preprocessing and Visualization sections of the project, and push your code to GitHub by Thursday December 4. (You do not need to upload anything to Canvas for this milestone.) Grading Rubric is here ( https://canvas.gmu.edu/courses/53052/files/19515728?wrap=1 )

The starter kit for creating your project is here: cds101_starter_kit.zip ( https://canvas.gmu.edu/courses/53052/files/19516386?wrap=1 )

This contains a template for the project proposal as well as the final report.

You should use this zipped file to create your own repository and share that repository with your team members. The repository should be public. Finally, you need to share the link to your repository along with the final report.
